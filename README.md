# Bookstore

The service is a simple online bookstore application that allows users to browse books, view book details, and perform
basic CRUD operations.

## Build

As usually:

```bash
mvn clean verify -PIT
```

Please keep in mind, the command above must always succeed. There is no excuse otherwise.

## Running in Docker container

### Required property

The `auth.key` property serves as the secret key used for signing and verifying JSON Web Tokens which is used for
user authentication.

The `auth.token.expiration` property defines the duration in hours of validity for JSON Web Tokens generated by
the application.

The `mongo.host` property specifies the MongoDB host. The default value is localhost.

The `mongo.database` property specifies the MongoDB database name. The default value is bookstore.

The `postgresql.host` property is used to specify the host (or address) of the PostgreSQL database server. The
default value is localhost.

The `postgresql.port` property is used to specify the port of the PostgreSQL database server. The
default value is 5432.

The `postgresql.username` and `postgresql.password` are used to specify username and password for connecting do DB.
The default value for both username and password is test.

### Docker-compose for running locally

```yaml
version: "2"
services:
  bookstore:
    image: bookstore:local
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    depends_on:
      - postgres_bookstore
      - mongo_bookstore
    environment:
      JAVA_OPTS: "-Dauth.key=c2VjcmV0LWtleQ== -Dauth.token.expiration=4 -Dpostgresql.host=postgres_bookstore -Dmongo.host=mongo_bookstore"
  postgres_bookstore:
    image: postgres:14-alpine
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    volumes:
      - ~/apps/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test
      - POSTGRES_USER=test
      - POSTGRES_DB=bookstore
  mongo_bookstore:
    image: mongo:latest
    ports:
      - 27017:27017
    volumes:
      - ~/apps/mongo:/var/lib/postgresql/data
```

Check the application status as, for instance:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/books
```

The output should be something like:

```json
[]
```
